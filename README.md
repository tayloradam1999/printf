# Printf

## This repository is the home of Rachel Lewis and Adam Taylor's handmade printf program.

### Our program has the same functionality of <stdio.h>'s printf.

### You are able to print whatever you want. Our program is capable of handling the following conversion specifiers:

* %c for characters
* %s for strings
* %d and %i for integers
* %u for unsigned integers
* %% for printing a percent sign
* %b for converting to binary
* %o for converting to octal
* %x for lowercase hexadecimal
* %X for uppercase hexadecimal
* %R for ROT13

### The return of our program is the total number of characters printed to screen.
