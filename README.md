# Printf

## This repository is home of Rachel Lewis and I's handmade printf program.

### Our program has the same functionality of <stdio.h>'s printf.

### You are able to print whatever you want, but as of now our program is only capable of handling the following conversion specifiers:

* %c for characters
* %s for strings
* %d and %i for integers
* %u for unsigned ints
* %% for printing a percent sign
* %b for binary
* %R for rot13
* %o for unsigned octal
* %x for lowercase hexadecimal
* %X for uppercase hexadecimal
* %r for reversing a string

### The return of our program is count, with count being how many characters are passed.
